# Create a variable called compnum and set the value to 50. Ask the user to
# enter a number. While their guess is not the same as the compnum value, tell
# them if their guess is too low or too high and ask them to have another guess.
# if they enter a same value as compnum, display the message "Well done, you took
# [count] attempts".
